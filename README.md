# For your betterment

Image editing React playground. Just trying something.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Development

You can run `npm start` to run the app in the development mode.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### Deployment

To deploy run `npm run deploy`.

Your app will deploy to [https://gabrieltal.github.io/yourbetterment](https://gabrieltal.github.io/yourbetterment)

To build the app for production to the build folder, run `npm run build`. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

### Tests

Run `npm test` to launch the test runner in the interactive watch mode. See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### Todo list

[ ] Make it better to adjust the position of the image, it isn't pleasant right now.
[ ] Maybe make the drag-and-drop better, like the image follows the cursor, if possible.
[ ] Make the resizing cuter.
[ ] Figure out if I can make it easy to save the image? Maybe need to do a canvas? IDK. Or maybe a button that lets you screenshot and ask if we can store it? I really don't know here. Gotta research if my vision is possible at all.
[ ] Clean up CSS
[ ] Clean up JS
