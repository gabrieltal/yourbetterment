Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes. You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### Deployment

To deploy run `npm run deploy`.

Your app will deploy to [https://gabrieltal.github.io/yourbetterment](https://gabrieltal.github.io/yourbetterment)

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
